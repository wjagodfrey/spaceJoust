It should really be called <strong>FLAPPY SUMO BATTLE</strong>, but I haven't gotten around to changing the name yet.</p><p>Anyway, welcome.</p><p><strong>SPACE JOUST</strong> is a same-keyboard multiplayer game, so you'll need a physical friend to play. This is solely because</p><ol><li>The developer (<a href="http://twitter.com/wjagodfrey" target="_blank">@wjagodfrey</a>) has fond memories of playing Gun Star Heros and Golden Axe with his big brother and having a tantrum when he couldn't win.</li><li>The developer doesn't have time/ is too lazy to add A.I. or online multiplayer. It's really a miracle this game exists at all.</li></ol><p>The goal in <strong>SPACE JOUST</strong> is to remove all of your enemy's respawn juice.<img src="./img/respawn_juice.png" title="respawn juice"></p><p>Every time a player dies and respawns they lose a little bit of respawn juice.</p><p>So to win, you have to kill your opponent. You can do this in a couple of different ways:</p><p><h3>Bombs</h3>Bombs come in four different flavours, depending on the directions they bounce in.
These are up and down, left and right, all at once, or not at all.<img src="./img/basic_bomb.gif" title="bomb gif"></p><p><h3>Lazors</h3>Lasers fry people and set off bombs. They can be turned on by<ol><li>stepping on buttons</li><li>bombs bouncing off buttons</li></ol><img src="./img/basic_laser.gif" title="laser gif"></p><p><h3>Getting Pushed Into The Lava</h3><p>Yes! This really is a game about flappy sumo wrestlers where the ground is lava an there are bombs everywhere.</p><p>This introduces the sumo aspect of the game as well. Just bounce into someone to set them sliding off their ledge and into the lava.</p><p>Want to really hurry things along? Butt slap them from above! The sound alone is so satisfying.</p><img src="./img/basic_lava.gif" title="lava gif"></p><h2>Items</h2><p><h3>No Wings</h3><p>Stops your opponents from flapping for a short while.<img src="./img/no_wings.gif" title="no wings gif"></p><h3>Add Life</h3><p>Gives you some more respawn juice.<img src="./img/add_life.gif" title="add life gif"></p><h3>Bombs</h3><p>Gives you a bomb to drop. The lines on the bomb indicate the direction it will bounce in.</p><p>A bomb arms only when you move away from it.<img src="./img/bomb.gif" title="bomb gif"></p></p><h2>Controls</h2><p><strong>M</strong> - mute in-game music</p><h3>Red Player</h3><p><strong>W</strong> - flap (keep pressing it!)<br><strong>S</strong> - dive (butt slap your opponent!)<br><strong>A</strong> - left<br><strong>D</strong> - right<br><strong>G</strong> - drop ze bombs</p><h3>Blue Player</h3><p><strong>⬆</strong> - flap (keep pressing it!)<br><strong>⬇</strong> - dive (butt slap your opponent!)<br><strong>⬅</strong> - left<br><strong>➡</strong> - right<br><strong>.</strong> - drop ze bombs</p><a href=".." class="page-link bottom">Play SPACE JOUST</a></div></body></html>
